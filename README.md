# JavaScript Practice Repository

This repository contains my JavaScript practice projects, exercises, and coding challenges.  
It is designed to track my learning journey, improve problem-solving skills, and explore different JavaScript concepts including:

- JavaScript fundamentals (variables, loops, functions, arrays, objects)  
- DOM manipulation & event handling  
- ES6+ features (arrow functions, destructuring, template literals, etc.)  
- Small projects and mini-apps  
- all has been wrapped with comment.
